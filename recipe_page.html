                <h2>What's a focaccia? And other technical considerations.</h2>
                <p>Massive, bubbly, crispy yet airy bread.</p>
                <p>Focaccias come in all shapes and sizes - you have the fine textured, cakey kind or the mad bubbly
                    kind, which is more popular here in London. But no matter which you prefer, the most important thing
                    about a focaccia is that it is rich with olive oil. And really good olive oil if you can.
                </p>
                <p>This focaccia is the ultra bubbly kind and it is seriously wet. Adding hydration to your bread has
                    become popular over the years, but it can make a dough very hard to work with. The best thing about
                    focaccia is that you get to enjoy the fruits of an ultra hydrated shattering-crusted crumb without
                    having to worry about the shape. We want it to be wild.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- intro into preferments -->
            <div class="technique-block" id="preferments">
                <h3>Preferments</h3>
                <p>Pre-ferments benefit your dough on multiple levels: Head start on fermentation and flavor.</p>
                <p>Here, we use a poolish: A wet pre-ferment. It is made with 100% hydration (equal water and flour) and
                    a small amount of yeast. The (g) weight of yeast is less important than you think - it just needs to
                    be enough to digest the flour in the poolish but not so much it&apos;ll be OTT once you add it into
                    the
                    rest of the mix.</p>
                <p>This is then left overnight to get bubbly and flavorful and then introduced into the dough. A
                    poolish, in particular, is known for providing additional extensibility (stretching!) to doughs so
                    is often used in croissants to add both flavor and ease for the laminating process. Basically, it
                    will improve your bread massively with very little effort.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Yeast in bread</h3>
                <p>When formulating a bread recipe, thinking about what it looks like will give you an idea of how much
                    yeast to use.</p>
                <p>
                    On the back of yeast packets and in bread recipes everywhere, 7g dry yeast to raise 500g flour seems
                    to be standard - this is just over 1%-2% of the flour weight. That&apos;s standard for anything from
                    bread rolls to loaves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For something flatter, like pizza or focaccia, the yeast content is much lower. According to the
                    book <a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Pizza-Practice-Handmade-Focaccia/dp/0399579222/ref=asc_df_0399579222?mcid=6c933f68fba331ff8aa692af8c408c9b&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=693301137777&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=16761578403970557173&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9016855&hvtargid=pla-524879127995&psc=1">Mastering
                        Pizza</a>, it&apos;s anywhere from 0.02% - 0.05%.
                </p>

                <h3>The journey of yeast</h3>
                <p>To understand its impact on flavor, it&apos;s important to understand the transformational journey
                    that
                    yeast goes through during breadmaking:</p>
                <ol class="yeast-journey">
                    <li>Yeast is mixed into dough</li>
                    <li>The yeast begins to eat / process the sugars present in the carbohydrates (flour), it begins to
                        create useful by-products for breadmaking...</li>
                    <li>As the dough is aerated during kneading, the yeast undergoes AEROBIC respiration because oxygen
                        is present and it produces CO2 + water. The bread rises fast when it is undergoing this
                        respiration but it isn&apos;t as flavorful</li>
                    <li>When there is a lack of oxygen present, the yeast switches to ANAEROBIC fermentation, where CO2
                        + ethanol + flavor compounds are the by-products. It is bit slower but provides more flavor
                    </li>
                    <li>As it respires / ferments, the gases produced by the yeasts are captured by the gluten network,
                        creating a network of structure and airpockets within the dough</li>
                    <li>The higher the temperature, the more yeast activity there is and the more CO2 is produced (it
                        rises more)</li>
                    <li>When the dough is stretched and folded or divided and shaped, these airpockets are redistributed
                        or collapsed entirely (deflated). The yeast will continue to ferment and produce by-products and
                        the bread will rise again as CO2 is captured in the gluten network. It will continue to do this
                        until it runs out of nutrition and there&apos;s nothing left to for the yeast to process,
                        getting continuously more sour</li>
                    <li>Eventually, the yeast has produced so much ethanol that it can no longer function</li>
                    <li>Further to the above, a dough can be deflated several times and re-shaped before the yeast is no
                        longer able to rise the dough.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <!-- this is the section about cold fermentation and developing flavor -->
            <div class="technique-block" id="developing-flavor">
                <h3>Developing flavor</h3>
                <p>Cold fermentation, and the reason why this focaccia takes 3 days, is a great lesson in both patience
                    paying off and flavour. To understand this, we have to remember that yeast is a fungi and loves a
                    warm environment and that temperature is really the only real thing that speeds up fermentation.
                    Useful as it is if you&apos;re in a rush to get the bread filled with CO2, it doesn&apos;t favour
                    flavour. </p>
                <p>Cold fermentation will slow the yeast activity right down which is a good thing, because when the
                    yeast isn&apos;t going absolutely nuts digesting sugar and producing CO2, it is really helpful in a
                    flavour creating process called the… wait for it… Alpha Amylase Reaction.</p>
                <p>I know, it&apos;s not a catchy name. But you don&apos;t need to know it by name. You just need to
                    know that it&apos;s an action where complex starches are further broken down into sugars and
                    flavours are made. Although this does happen if you just left flour and water on its own, yeast -
                    when under control in a cold environment - can provide some useful enzyme action to coax those
                    flavours out, and provide new dimensions for your bread.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- gluten section -->
            <div class="technique-block" id="gluten">
                <h3>Building strength</h3>
                <p>I know we&apos;ve been through this before but let&apos;s quickly recap: Flour contains proteins -
                    Glutenin and Gliadin - that, in the presence of water, form gluten bonds. Gluten provides structure,
                    shape and stretch to your dough. The presence of gluten allows a dough to be both elastic (holds its
                    shape) and extensible (stretches). Although mechanically kneading the dough can help build strength
                    in the dough and organise the gluten bonds, gluten will form very happily on its own.</p>
                <p>For this recipe, we aren&apos;t going to totally leave the bread alone but we are going to be gentle.
                    I personally love the folding and stretching process of the focaccia - it feels SO good to get your
                    hands covered in olive oil and gently stretch the dough. While most of the gluten developing is
                    happening without our assistance, we support the strength building with a series of gentle movements
                    that are surprisingly effective given how minor they look.</p>
                <p>When you&apos;re stretching and folding you can try a few different techniques - as long as you are
                    gently stretching the dough, it doesn&apos;t matter!</p>

            <h3>Day 1</h3>
            <ol>
                <li class="instruction">Mix the flour, yeast and water together to make a poolish. Cover and leave the
                    poolish for 12 hours.</li>
                <li class="instruction">After 12 hours, it should be bubbly and 'ripe', aka ready to use. You can check
                    it's well aerated by seeing if it floats in water.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Day 2</h3>
            <ol>
                <li class="instruction">Mix the poolish, flour, water, and yeast together until it forms a rough dough.
                    It will look shaggy and ugly. Cover and leave to autolyse for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Dissolve the salt in the water and then mix this into the dough - squeeze it in
                    with your hands until combined. Rest for 30 minutes, keeping it covered. Now add 1-2 tablespoons of
                    olive oil, coat your hands and stretch and fold the dough - pick the dough up from the middle,
                    stretching it, then folding it over itself gently. Repeat this four to five times until smooth.
                    Cover and leave for 1 hour.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Add 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil and stretch and fold the dough - it should be
                    quite puffy at this stage.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Cover and leave for 1 hour - it should be getting puffy and big each time you
                    leave it.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Check the gluten development. It should be stronger but may not be fully
                    developed (eg. the dough tears). If needed, add more olive oil and stretch the dough.</li>
                <li class="instruction">After 30 minutes, check the gluten development agiain - you should be able to
                    make a thin stretchy windowpane. If it is well developed, you can move it into an oiled tub and put
                    it into the fridge. Keep it covered so it doesn't dry out.</li>
                <li class="instruction">After an hour, check and de-gas the dough by pressing it down.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Cover and leave for at least 8 hours, ideally overnight.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Day 3</h3>
            <ol>
                <li class="instruction">With oiled hands, move the dough onto an oiled baking tray, balling it in your
                    hands slightly to help give it a smooth surface. Spread the dough out slightly, then cover with
                    olive oil so it doesn't form a crust. Leave for 1 - 1.5 hours until it relaxes.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Oil your hands, then dimple the top of the dough and redistribute the air
                    bubbles. You can also lift up the edges and sides of the focaccia, which can help reveal hidden side
                    bubbles! Leave for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Preheat the oven to 250&deg;C/485&deg;F.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Dimple the dough again with oiled hands and press toppings in (if using).
                    Remember to poke them quite deep into the dough, especially ingredients prone to burning (like
                    herbs). Top it off with a sprinkle of flaky salt.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Bake for 10 minutes, then turn the oven down to 220&deg;C/425&deg;F and bake for
                    a further 10-15 minutes until golden. Remove from tray and cool on a rack.</li>
                <li class="instruction">Focaccia is best enjoyed the day it is made, but you can store it in the fridge
                    for 3 days and reheat in the oven.</li>
